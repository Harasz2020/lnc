## Battleships

A simple multiplayer sink my battleships app.

## Getting the Client Software

Compile from source or download the installer for Microsoft Windows.

[Windows Installer](https://github.com/JensDerKrueger/lnc/raw/master/cpp/OpenGL/26_BattleShips/VS/Output/setup.exe)

## Client Usage

Simply start the client. It will ask you for a server address (feel free to use our game server, details below) and your username. Once the connection has been established, the game will wait for another player. Once it has found another player, it will connect you and ask you to place your armada. You have to place six ships total, one 2-square ship, two 3-square ships, two 4-square ships, and one 5-square ship. Use the 'r'- key to roate the ship and the 'u' key to undo a plaemen.
Once you have placed all of your ships the game will wait for your oponent. Once the oponent has
also completed the armada setup the game will begin. 

## Demo Server
